# Java Algorithm Analysis Project

This project focuses on the analysis of algorithms, specifically the ACB and ACO algorithms. Additionally, a comparison between three algorithms is included.

## Running ACB and ACO

To execute the ACB and ACO algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Compile the Java classes:

    ```bash
    javac MainTest.java
    ```

3. Run the MainTest class:

    ```bash
    java MainTest
    ```

## Running Algorithm Comparison

For comparing the three algorithms, proceed as follows:

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Compile the Java classes:

    ```bash
    javac compareTime.java
    ```

3. Run the compareTime class:

    ```bash
    java compareTime
    ```

## Algorithm Folders

Each algorithm has its dedicated folder in the project structure. To access a specific algorithm's Java implementation, navigate to the corresponding folder.
