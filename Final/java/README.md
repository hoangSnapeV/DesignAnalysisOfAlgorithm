# Java Algorithm Analysis Project

This project focuses on the analysis of algorithms, specifically the IMCRO. Additionally, a comparison between three algorithms, include IMCRO, ABC, ACO

## Running MainTest IMCRO, ACB and ACO

To execute the ACB and ACO algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Compile the Java classes:

    ```bash
    javac MainTestIMCRO.java
    javac MainTestABC.java
    javac MainTestACO.java
    ```
    or 
    ```
    javac *.java
    ```

3. Run the MainTest class:

    ```bash
    java MainTestIMCRO
    java MainTestABC
    java MainTestACO
    ```

## Running Algorithm Comparison

For comparing the three algorithms, proceed as follows:

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Compile the Java classes:

    ```bash
    javac compareTime.java or javac *.java
    ```

3. Run the compareTime class:

    ```bash
    java TimeComparison
    ```
